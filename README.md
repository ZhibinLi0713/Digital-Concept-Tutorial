#### Target Audience: IT beginner user with basic knowledge about computer components

**Primary Components:**
- CPU
- GPU
- RAM
- Motherboard
- Hard Drives
- Power Source
- Cooling system
- I/O and SATA


**Why does these components matter?:** This is like a question asking what is the advantages using desktop instead of laptop. General consumers of computers typically purchase pre-fabricated machines. They work for most, but we could need more power. Here's some benefits for building your own computer.

- Catered towards the software or purpose of the machine based on your needs
- Understanding your system helps to define capabilities, also limitation.
- Cost savings when focused on “what you need” rather than pre-fabricated brand combination
- Consider this machine as a work station

**Things before you build the computer:**

- Understanding how software works with hardware acceleration because not all softwares are optimized
- Think about brand cost and the actually performance
- Some pieces work well together while others are completely incompatible
- Decide the CPU or motherboard at the beginning because usually they are dependent

**Scenario:**6K resolution 6144 x 3072, a very common capture rate in the industry these days, it has 18,874,368 pixels per frame.Exporting time or render time will be very long with most computer.

**Tools:**These tools maybe used when you build your own machine.

Benchmarks

- Definition of how well components work together because components works in different way
- Try it yourself to see how well your pc is.

PC Part Picker

- A website you can use to see if parts work well together or if there might be any challenges you should be aware of
- You can also skip this if you want to do this on IbuyPower or CyberPower
- Always check the CPU and motherboard
